# Qualification

OrbitTE distinguishes three states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | A reachable source path owns and performs the behavior |
| Qualified | The declared code/artifact passes its stated source or hardware profile |
| Accepted | An independent reviewer inspects the change and verifies its applicable gates |

A successful build or CPU fixture does not qualify physical DMA, a new fabric,
GPU direct transfer or performance.

## Current native RDMA evidence

The latest context-selection source, `4b3638c`, passes 13 sequential stable /
Rust 1.85 source and build gates, with 179 all-feature unit tests per toolchain.
Its two frozen binaries pass 48 two-host CPU DRAM / IPv6 RoCEv2 regression
cases. All 96 peers are reaped and the original NIC locks are released.

The regression includes shared-CQ and context-specific MR ownership, connected
reuse, duplex transfers, actual CQ errors and actual partial post admission.
Sixteen same-RNIC registration helpers account for 32 real PDs and 64 native
MR registration/deregistration receipts. Three CPU mutation controls reject
ignored device masks, compacted NIC IDs and removed cached-PD validation.

These are same-agent scoped gates using one selected RNIC per host. They do
not qualify scheduling over two physical RNICs. Independent acceptance and
the full native P4 stage remain open.

See the [detailed evidence and reproduction contract](rdma-cuda.md#scoped-p412b-validation)
for frozen binary hashes, native library identities, external artifact paths
and the negative controls. Raw logs, profiles, generated figures and per-run
reports remain outside the checkout and Git history.

## CPU and historical profiles

The [frozen CPU comparison](cpu-oracle.md) runs a shared behavioral trace
against unmodified native TENT in separate processes. It compares bytes,
registration, batch and notification observations; it does not establish
mixed-peer wire compatibility.

Earlier accepted TCP, host registration, source MW, key domain, shared-progress
and connected-reuse profiles remain scoped to their recorded source/artifacts.
Historical NVIDIA host-staging and consumer experiments do not qualify a new
GPUDirect path or a new installed consumer. The [RDMA contract](rdma-cuda.md)
preserves those records and their limits.

## Remaining stage boundary

The [completion plan](completion-plan.md) owns the delivery sequence. Complete
P4 before renewing OrbitKV integration. Outstanding work includes physical
multi-RNIC selection, cross-rail request slicing, eager context registration
publication, physical fault/shutdown controls and independent acceptance.
GDR and optional storage transports have their own stages.
